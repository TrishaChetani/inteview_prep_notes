# Sorting

- Most fundamental algorithm in computer science. 
- **"when in doubt, sort"** is one of  first rules of algorithm design. 

## Choosing the sorting algorithm

### How many keys will you be sorting?
| Number of elements | insertion sort |
|--|--|
| n<=100 |  |

 - when n <=100, insertion sort is faster, simpler. shell sort also works. 
 - when n>100, pick any O(nlogn) algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort.
