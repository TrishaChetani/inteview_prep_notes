# Sorting

- Most fundamental algorithm in computer science. 
- **"when in doubt, sort"** is one of  first rules of algorithm design. 

## Choosing the sorting algorithm

### How many keys will you be sorting?
| Number of elements | Sorting algorithm |
|--|--|
| n<=100 | insertion sort, shell sort |
| n > 100 | O(nlogn) algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort |
| n > 5,000,000| External-memory sorting algorithms |
