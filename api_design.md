# API Design Best Practices

### Why is API Design important to you?
* If you program, then you are an API designer
	* Good code is modular - each module has an API
* Useful modules tend to get reused
	* good reusable modules are corporate assets
	* once module has users, can't change users at will
* thinking in terms of APIs improves code quality
* Start with with one page API spec
* Start with example usage/implementation code as you Spec API
* Writing Service Provider Interface for API is important.
