# Data Models

### Introduction

Data Models are most important part of software development, as they have effect not only on how s/w is being written, but also on *how we thing about the problem* we are solving. 

Data Models help layered visuation of the problem. For example, 

* application developers think real world problem in terms of objects, or data structures.
* objects or data structures in turn can be expressed in terms of general purpose data model i.e. JSON/XML documents, tables in relational DB, or a graph model.
* engineers who build databases software decide a way of representing these JSON/XML/relational/graph models in terms of bytes in memory, or disk or in network.
* on yet lower level, h/w engineers figured out to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, or magentic fields or pules of light.

### Relational vs Document model
